			<h2>Climate Change</h2>
		</column>

		<column class="cdes">
			<p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, weather patterns, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. It is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), which releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming of the planet, known as global warming. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events (like hurricanes, floods, and droughts), disruptions to ecosystems, and negative impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health. Addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and adapting to its inevitable impacts.</p>

			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		</column>

		<column class="wawdes">
			<p>We, the Climate Needs Help society, are united towards our mission to combat climate change and build a sustainable future. Every action, whether small or big, can be of great help for the planet’s future. Let us introduce to you how we are making an impact.</p>
		</column>
		
		<column class="ques1">
			<h2>1. Empowering Communities for Change</h2>
		</column>
		<column class="des1">
			<p>Local communities are the key to fight climate change. We aim to partner with schools, especially in the rural places to raise awareness, share knowledge, and create a change in their practices. We also aim to collaborate with other organizations with the movements as we believe that unifying each other allows us to further spread awareness. By empowering individuals, we create a society that will protect our planet.</p>
			<p><strong>Programs:</strong> Climate education workshops, community clean-ups, sustainable living programs.</p>
		</column>
		
		<column class="ques2">
			<h2>2. Advocating for Policy and Systemic Change</h2>
		</column>
		<column class="des2">
			<p>Our mission focuses on creating policies locally, nationally, or even globally. We want to make sure that our government prioritizes sustainable practices, renewable energy, and overall improved human practices, especially the ones that have an effect on nature.</p>
			<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong> Lobbying for renewable energy incentives, supporting carbon pricing policies, pushing for stronger climate regulations.</p>
		</column>
		
		<column class="ques3">
			<h2>3. Protecting Our Planet’s Ecosystems</h2>
		</column>
		<column class="des3">
			<p>From oceans to forests, we focus on restoring nature’s natural environment. We have reforestation and wildlife initiatives which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.</p>
			<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong> Tree planting campaigns, ocean cleanup efforts, habitat restoration projects.</p>
