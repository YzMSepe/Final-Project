					Climate change has continuously affected every country including the livelihoods of people and the economy.  It worsens weather events, threatens food and water supplies, and may lead to conflict. Fortunately, we can prevent this by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building climate resilience and improving lives by transforming energy, industry, agriculture and transport. Together we must support organizations with climate mitigation strategies like reforestations and agroforestry.
