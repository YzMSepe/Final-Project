			<h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
				
			<p> 
				Climate change, the long term change in temperature and weather patterns, is currently affecting the lives of people in a detrimental manner. Though it was a normal phenomena in the past, due to the extensive production of greenhouse gasses from human activities, it has significantly increased. The major greenhouse gasses produced include methane, which can be produced from gasoline or burning coal. Deforestation, agricultural waste and industrial activities also play a major role in this event.

			<h3>What Can We Do?</h3>
			<p>Effects of climate change have been seen everywhere and it is undoubtedly affecting us humans, animals, plants and the environment. Together, we should focus on triggering climate change more. We must engage in the use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Simple things such as riding a bike rather than riding a car is a big help to the environment. We can also push for sustainable agriculture as it is also a major player in greenhouse gas production. We must protect the forests, oceans and all other natural habitat because they help in carbon absorption. Lastly, spread awareness especially to people who are unaware of the result of their actions. </p>

				<p>Earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 0.11°F (0.06°C) per decade since 1850, totaling about 2°F. Since 1982, the rate of warming has accelerated to 0.36°F (0.20°C) per decade. In 2023, global temperatures reached a record high, surpassing the 20th-century average by 2.12°F (1.18°C) and the pre-industrial average by 2.43°F (1.35°C). Notably, the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past decade (2014-2023). </p>
